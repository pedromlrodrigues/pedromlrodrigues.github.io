          <h3><strong>Software Engineer</strong></h3>
          <p><strong>Armis Group</strong> | <i>Feb 2020 - Jul 2021</i></p>

          <h4>Projects:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span><strong>C-ITS Platform - </strong></span>
              European project under the C-ROADS Portugal program. Engineered a
              platform for real-time traffic control, driver notifications, and
              road event management.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Developed the backend in .NET Core to receive and process
                  real-time data from roadside units (RSUs) via MQTT. This
                  system managed information such as location, temperature, and
                  status, as well as road event data like traffic jams and
                  accidents, before making it available for accurate
                  visualization on the platform's frontend.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Designed and implemented RESTful APIs for the frontend to
                  create and broadcast road events to all connected RSUs within
                  a specified geographic range.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Developed the logic for RSU auto-location, allowing new units
                  to automatically connect and display on the map based on their
                  latitude and longitude coordinates.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="mt-1">
              <span><strong>CaetanoBUS NEXT -</strong></span>
              A collaborative project under the C-ROADS Portugal program with
              Salvador Caetano, STCP, and Porto City Hall. This initiative
              focused on managing smart traffic lights for bus priority,
              handling real-time road events, and facilitating data exchange via
              the CAN interface/OBU (On-board Unit) connection.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Developed a client to receive real-time road events via MQTT,
                  which were then displayed on a lightning panel in the back of
                  the bus.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Implemented the logic for smart traffic light management,
                  enabling public transport buses to receive priority at
                  intersections based on the proximity of their onboard units.
